				<p class="kk" >Being rather studious, I don't normally play games, or even have the time to play games, but Roblox has been something that I frequently come back to. I was in grade 6 when I first found Roblox on the Play Store. I had no idea what it was and what to expect, but the idea of a game ception appealed to me as there would be a greater selection of games to choose from. My first account was made then, and I was off. I remember my first few games to consist of an obby, as well as a tycoon, which got me hooked. The controls were really easy to get used to and it was easy to complete most parkour levels, save for a select few. Tycoons had the rare satisfaction of a growing business, the neverending collection of money, the building of new machines and purchase of gear that could allow me to fly or turn invisible, was intoxicating(for a grade 6 me). The one downside of tycoons were the fact that most other players had it on their minds to kill you before you even started the game yet, often slashing their swords behind your back as you hurry to run away, oblivious to <i>what</i> exactly you got into. Even after you started a tycoon, they couldn't leave you alone, and you’d have to make building walls your first priority. Although this was a rare aspect, and never happened in other types of games(as they did not have weapons), it quickly got me out of tycoons. After a few months on Roblox, I found a list of games that I could steadily come back to, knowing that I wouldn't get bored.</p>
				<h3>My Game Recommendations</h3>
				<p class="one">Loomian Legacy</p>
				<img src="images/loom.jpg" align="right" class=loom>
				<p class="onedesc">Straight off the bat, this is my favourite game on Roblox ever. It is very similar to Pokemon in a way, but I’ve personally never played Pokemon before so it doesn't get at all boring. This game has a lenient storyline that you follow, based around an ancient tomb that has split into pieces scattered across the world by an evil darkness. You are sent out with your first Loomian(Pokemon) to go around towns, finding the lost pieces. You encounter other loomis and you get into battles which level up your loomian(s). You are able to catch more, but medicine and antidotes to poisons, get in-game boosts, trade with other players in the trade center, battle with others, and more. The one downside to this game though, is that you cannot jump, otherwise, it is amazing and i would rate it a 5/5.</p>
