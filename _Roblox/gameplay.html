				<p>Roblox hosts user-created games in virtual worlds in a wide variety of genres, from traditional racing, to tycoons, simulators, and obstacle courses. In the settings tab, you are able to select your movement, joy-stickes, thumbpad, WASD, arrow-keys, and more. The app will change to fit your device, whether your playing from your computer, or your phone or tablet. Your view can also be changed to fit to your liking, from a follow-camera, to a first person view.
				Depending on the different games that you want to play, some controls are monitored or restricted. For example, Loomian Legacy, a game created by "Llama Studios" is a storyline game that is simular to Pokemon. In this game, you are not able to jump, thus meaning you can only goes forwards, left, right. or backwards. This proves to become a nuiance after awhile, but the player will get accustomed to it.
				Some games grant the players items to use throughout the game, ranging from guns, cannons, to hoverboards or jetpacks. There are also special effects and game pases that you can buy with Robux, the currency in the game. To keep the player motivated, they earn achievments when they succeed in getting past a particular challenge. </p>
