				<p>Roblox hosts user-created games in a virtual world. With a wide variety of games, ranging from traditional racing to tycoons, simulators, and obstacle courses, it is impossible to become bored with. Varying with different genres of games, the gameplay is infinite and is normally not set in stone. Storyline games don’t force you to follow the plot, you are in control and are able to decide where to go first, before completing the task. Tycoon games are straightforward, you build machines to make money, and the richest team or person is on the top of the leaderboard. One really great thing about Roblox is that there isn’t a very noticeable ranking scheme in most of the games. In racing, there is a sure winner, but most others it is impossible to tell. This is a really unique aspect as most games feature a leaderboard and rankings. Which gives off a negative aspect if you are not in the top three, or even the winner. Without it, this boosts self-esteem and makes playing much more fun. Along with that, you can also earn achievements when you succeed in getting past a particular challenge, motivating the player even more. </p>
				<h3>Controls</h3>
				<img src="images/menu.png" width="500px" height="350px" align="right" class="menu">
				<p>The controls are easy enough, with a variety of selection available to the player. Your view method itself has 3 variations that can fit to your liking, Classic, Follow, and Default. The movement has a bigger variety, ranging from the old-fashioned thumbstick, to tapping to move, to even a thumbpad. You are able to switch from first person view, second, and third person views. Roblox is compatible with any device, whether it be a computer, tablet, or even a phone. Although with most games, you are free to use any of the controls, some games, such as Loomian Legacy, by Llama Studios, restrict certain controls. In Loomian Legacy, a storyline game that is similar to Pokeman, you are unable to jump, thus meaning you can only go forwards, backwards, and side-to-side. This becomes a nuisance but is adaptable after a bit of playing. Some games also grant players specific items, ranging from guns and cannons, to hoverboards or jetpacks, which require specific new controls that are harder to learn after a while. </p>
