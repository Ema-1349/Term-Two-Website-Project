				<p>Roblox is a massive multiplayer online video game and a game creation system that allows users to design their own games and play a wide variety of different types of games created by other users. The platform hosts user-created games and virtual worlds covering a wide variety of genres, from traditional racing and role-playing games, to simulations and obstacle courses.
				Games are coded under an Object Oriented Programming system utilizing the programming language Lua to manipulate the environment of the game. Users are able to create game passes, which are purchasable content through one-time purchases, as well as microtransactions through developer products. Developers on the site exchange Robux earned from various products on their games into real world currency through the Developer Exchange system. A percentage of the revenue from purchases is split between the developer and Roblox. It allows players to buy, sell, and create virtual items. Clothes can be bought by anyone, but only players with a premium membership can sell them. Only Roblox administrators can sell accessories, body parts, gear, and packages under the official Roblox user account. Items with a limited edition status can only be traded between or sold by users with premium membership status. Robux is the virtual currency in Roblox that allows players to buy various items. Players can obtain Robux by purchasing Robux with real currency, from a recurring Robux stipend given to members with premium membership, and from other players by selling virtual content on Roblox.
